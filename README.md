## Space Invader  

This is a practice project. Space Invaders is one of the classic arcade games of all time and is also a popular personal project for someone who wants to learn and improve their coding skills. The aim of this specific project is:  
- Using a barebones 2D game library (pygame) instead of a game engine.  
- Learning about the game loop.  
- Processing human input.  
- Creating and managing enemy objects and handling their states.  
- Handling framerate and, in general, handling the frequency of changing states to make sure the game feels like an experience and not a project.

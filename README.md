## Space Invader Clone

This is a practce project. Space Invaders is one of the classic arcade games and is also a popular personal project for someone who wants to learn and improve their coding skills. The aim of this specific project is -> 
- Using a barebones 2D game library (pygame) instead of a game engine.
- Learning about game loop.
- Processing human input.
- Creating and managing enemy objects and handling their states.
- Handling framerate and in general handling frequency of changing states to make sure the game feels like an experience and not a project.
